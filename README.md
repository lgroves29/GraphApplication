# Graph Application

An application for creating and searching graphs. Includes a user interface with implementations of both depth and breadth first searches of the graph and Dijkstra's algorithm.

## Usage
Running the GraphicalUserInterface opens the GUI. In this the user can add nodes and edges to their graph and run breadth and depth first searches on the graph, as well as run Dijkstra's algorithm on any two connected nodes.
